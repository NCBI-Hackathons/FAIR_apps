# FAIR Apps

Monday and Tuesday, April 15-16, 2019
Seaport World Trade Center in Boston, MA

The Jackson Laboratory is working with the registration of an application through the specification of inputs and outputs and the expected transformation as a POC accomplishing two things. One, being agnostic to platform and two being FAIR. Extending the principles of FAIR to applications which transform input to another form by algorithms, e.g. machine learning algorithm, normalization or transformation algorithms.
